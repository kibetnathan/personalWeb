			<p>I have done many projects most of them are incomplete including Addidas ,Memeyou ,Tokyo ghoul and even onePiece.All those are just practice projects and are not official but be sure that this is an official website.The only projects i will present to you are these ones and you will see that they are indeed impressive for someone of my age.I took almost a whole day to make some of these projects or even more.At the end of this website there will be links to some of my other unpublished projects.i started coding in 2017 and as you see i have been doing well ever since.The work i have done is immeasureable and i am always open to do more any day and anyone can be surprised by this but i am not the only one who can do this i just use the ability better since i am always open to work.</p>

			<p>I have many hobies such as rugby ,tennis ,gaming ,coding ,writing ,reading and my personal favourite browsing memes on meme base.I mostly do gaming and i also have a youtube channel known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwbLtzrr7vuZXy6ZX6KcTpg?view_as=subscriber">Aether Z</a> so click that link i have left on it to go to my channel and subscribe.Dont be quick to judge it because I just started it recently and i am only  just getting used to the basics.Back to the main topic.The main games i play are The Battle Cats ,Roblox and io games.I play io games because they are very many and are easy to start.you don't need to install these io games to your laptop or pc but you do need to install them on mobile.Same with Roblox but you need to install the launcher on pc and laptops.The Battle cats is a fully mobile game.On the writing topic i am writing a book called Hoods I.I have not yet published it so don't go to the nearest bookshop to confirm or by any chance buy it(if you are reading this in the future then please purchase it if i manage to publish it and get it to a bookshop.).</p>

			<p>I have already told you alot but this is just giving you the background information.I go to moi educational centre one of the top schoos in Kenya.I am currently moving to class 7 and this year I was in class 6 south.I live in a family of 5 people. two brothers a father and a Mother.My brothers are Adrian and Matthew both are younger than me but Adrian is older than Matthew.that makes me the oldest child which comes with its perks and problems.Let me start with the problems.The first one is your siblings havent learnt as much as you have thus you cannot reason with them.Second is the excuse of their bad  behaviour your actions even though it is'nt your fault.Third one is the endless disturbances thus a non productive environment and the urge to really just give them a good slap.The perks are, 1 You are allowed to give them minor commands such as,"Please help me get my book.".Second you are allowed to give them minor punishments depening on their age, your age and the wrong done. Third you get a seperate room depending on the number of siblings you have. Fourth when they grow up you have unseperaable friends. My best friends are Davis, Kevin, Bennedict and Timothy.All of them are really close but my co-workers Nesh and Malli are becoming closer every day. I enjoy working with them a whole lot but sometimes they do their work fast and it ends up looking bad but we always correct each others mistakes. We work in tales agency and we are the founding fathers. We do websites for other companies which are unable to do so.  Sometimes it is hard for us to decide on designs and so we ask the companies to choose for themselves. We founded the company on 2017 03 November.</p>
